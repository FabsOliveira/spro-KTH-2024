 Material for short course: stochastic programming and robust optimisation


## Using the notebooks

To run the notebook examples you will need [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#install_julia) installed.

Once Julia is intalled, run Julia to start your REPL and type

`]` to open the package manager

`activate .` to create an environment locally

`instantiate` to install the required packages to the environment.


## Opening the notebooks

To use Julia with Jupyter notebooks, you need to use a package called `IJulia.jl`. The following commands will open a Jupyterlab session for you with a Julia kernel available:

start by running Julia to start your REPL and type

`using IJulia` to load the package

`jupyterlab()` to start the Jupyterlab server.
